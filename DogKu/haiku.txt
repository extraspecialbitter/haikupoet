cowering
in the back of the kennel --
last year's Christmas present 

darker and sadder
than a cold winter night --
her eyes

year of the dog --
a rawhide chew toy
under my pillow

new moon --
my pillow smells
like a dog 

patch of sun --
the dog
takes a nap 

hot summer night --
the dog's breath
against my leg 

farmers market --
an old dog
transfixed by plums

dog days --
the dog
dazed

hunter's moon --
the tension at the end
of the dog's leash 

winter thaw --
our dog finds a hole
in the fence 

Valentine's Day
awakened by a kiss
from the dog 

quiet moment --
a dog toy presses
against my leg 

Tax Day --
the dog eats
only half her meal

distant thunder --
I walk our dog
in the rain 

heat wave --
the dog's breath
against my leg

a break in the heat --
the dog climbs back
into our bed 

full moon --
the dog pulls especially hard
on the leash

late night thunderstorm --
we invite the dog
into bed 

nuclear standoff --
a child throws stones
at a sleeping dog 

between rain showers --
the dog trembles
in her sleep

end of summer --
the dog's paw prints
on the picnic table

fall begins --
a stale dog biscuit
in my jacket pocket 

gibbous moon --
the dog sees something
I don't 

wrong number --
the dog climbs into
my side of the bed 

october wind --
the dog guards
a freshly fallen acorn

harvest moon --
the dog
poops twice 

gibbous moon --
a stray dog
keeps its distance

snow in the forecast --
the dog paces
back and forth 

in the storm
before the calm
I walk the dog 

Thanksgiving night --
everyone thanks me
for walking the dog

November twilight --
the dog's nose
twitches 

winter dog walk --
wondering what she sees
behind the shadows 

walking the dog
on a cold winter night
I remember all my sins

gibbous moon --
the dog's eyes
widen 

cloudless sky --
nobody notices
my bad  hair day
