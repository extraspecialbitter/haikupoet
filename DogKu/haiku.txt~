cowering
in the back of the kennel --
last year's Christmas present 

darker and sadder
than a cold winter night --
her eyes

year of the dog --
a rawhide chew toy
under my pillow

new moon --
my pillow smells
like a dog 

patch of sun --
the dog
takes a nap 

hot summer night --
the dog's breath
against my leg 

farmers market --
an old dog
transfixed by plums

dog days --
the dog
dazed

hunter's moon --
the tension at the end
of the dog's leash
