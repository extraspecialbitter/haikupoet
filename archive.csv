all of these birds,pretending to know nothing,about last night's rain,
mockingbird sings ,to the rhythm ,of the freeway,
long meeting: ,so tired ,of doodling,
my fingers,clutching the air,where your hair once was,
October morning,the alarm clock,is increasingly darker,
outside Penn Station,a blind beggar,counts his change,
late July night,a blues guitar,sweltering,
following,the tattoo,up the back of her leg,

first raindrops --,the fragrance,of hot cement,
approaching storm --,the thunder,of frightened geese,
Veteran's Day rain --,an old man holds an umbrella,above the monument,
mid-March blizzard,a snow plow,mired in mud,
the heat wave continues,she no longer adjusts,her falling shoulder strap,
holiday approaching,I ride into work,with my shades on,
long nights at the bar,drinking cold ale,to stay warm,
smiling,between suitcases,a cabbage patch doll,
summer night ,the amber sky ,still shimmering,
one week before Christmas,the frozen stares,of last-minute shoppers,
behind the sheer curtain,her silhouette,brushes her hair,
full of beer,I stare,at your empty chair,
sleepless night,whispering,among mosquitoes,
twilight,the cold medicine changes,from DayQuil to NyQuil,
approaching Harvard Square,I ignore the stranger,who wants to make friends,
the disk jockey,taps his foot,slightly off the beat,
clothed in purple,- sunset,
the waitress,now serving,spaghetti straps,
fighting for the phone,my children wish me,happy Father's Day,
reading,under the flashing neon light,one line at a time,
all day long,I sing the song,of the wind chimes,
Long Island Sound,the silence,of two ships passing,
July afternoon,sharing a lemon,with the sun,
memories of the beach,pouring,from my sneaker,
the old house,ivy vines encircle,a rusted swing set,
the night after Christmas,putting away,the less-favored toys,
Austin brewpub --,a patron orders,a cold sweaty blonde,
Christmas shopping,the long wait,between mouse clicks,
shortest day --,dinner candles,drowning in wax,
Wall Street reels,but there are plenty of acorns,in my backyard,
summer morning,the lingering haze,of too much beer,
temperature rising,the sundress gently slips,from her shoulder,
cool summer night ,the rise and fall ,of satin sheets,
examining my watch --,your smile,
weaving between,empty wine bottles,Christmas garland,
at happy hour,patrons and problems,line the bar,
unable to sleep,I turn on the fan,to drown out the silence,
moments before dawn,I finally sleep,to the music of rain,
New England blues club --,the businessman watches the blonde,go home with the biker,
the perfect Boston pub,where nobody,knows my name      ,
awake all night,your angry words,in the wind,
Cambridge brewpub --,MIT dropouts,engineer hangovers,
winter night,the hum,of the humidifier,
watching Casablanca,I grip your hand,tightly,
leaving Minnesota --,in my rear-view mirror,a shooting star,
on the answering machine,my children sing,Happy Birthday,
cold and overcast,wishing,it would finally rain,
sudden cloudburst --,the street puddles,join hands,
happily married couple,exchanging      ,email,
waiting for the bus,her miniskirt,and me,
cracked mirror --,my daughter reads,my lonely haiku,
after the debate,I vote,for another beer,
if she smiles at me,one more time,I'll just sit here :^),
busy squirrels,remind me,summer is almost gone,
repairing the fishing nets,her hair gently unfurls,
taking the early train,mist rises,from my coffee,
climbing the stairs,her tight black miniskirt,leaves me breathless,
thanks to the neighbors' door slams,I catch the sunrise,
spring in the air,approaching Wellesley Hills,she lets her hair down,
my old cotton robe,even softer,when she wears it,
running after my dog,I am no longer young...,
approaching storm ,shadows flee ,beneath the trembling trees,
Thursday morning hangover --,in the distance,a blues guitar,
calling my children: ,a long-distance overdose ,of Nickelodeon,
reading The Globe,he turns each page,before I finish,

this dark ale,slowly overshadows,my pain,
home after a rough day,even my cats stay away,
Copley Station,the accordion plays,Love Potion #9,
preparing to move,only my beer,remains unpacked,
summer tragedy --,her long silky hair,tied up in a bun,
when I finally fall asleep,the rain pauses,to gaze at the moon,
stepping from the shower,a freshly drawn heart,on the mirror,
summer snow ,an invasion ,of dandelion seeds,
clinging to my shoe,the season's,first brown leaf         ,
October morning,the sun is much too bright,without coffee,
Italian restaurant,now serving,spaghetti straps,
outdoor concert ,the sweltering heat ,of good salsa,
after the rain,even the construction cranes,sleep,
November night,stepping from the train,into a full moon,
artist's bedroom --,four bare walls,and a mattress,
the 10:05 train,counting the weary miles,between you and me,
curdled cream,and bitter coffee --,a fax from my attorney,
right on schedule,she passes me by,- summer girl,
caressing your fingertips,these fragile blossoms,
Cochituate twilight,a doe and fawn  ,scavenge for berries,
on-line again,writing these words,about the beautiful day,
cold and alone,in the eastern sky,millennium moon,
troubled sleep,a truck crashes,through an ice puddle,
after the storm,rainbows play,in street puddles,
halfway across the world,missing you,and the moon,
the leaves change color --,my older children,unable to visit,
sunset,reflected,in the laundromat window,
reflecting the moonlight,her black vinyl skirt,
at sunrise,a Harley races by,-- so fleeting,
two weeks later,all that's left,is a withered rose,
city crosswalk,all eyes,on her miniskirt,
unable to write ,unwilling to drink ,this cool white Russian ,
Dupont Circle --,a young man banging cans,for money,
DC tavern --,environmentalists,belch,
Union Station --,the deep dark shine,of a prostitute's boots,
the umpire's bad call --,a rotten peanut,at the bottom of the bag,
summer drizzle --,a cat sleeps,undisturbed,
another birthday,another six pack,shared with my cats,
high above Times Square,tourists photograph,the falling scaffolding,
across the bar from me,a blind date,stumbles,
obstructing my view,her head,on his shoulder,
dressed for the storm,a mannequin stands vigil,over snowswept streets,
New England suburb,the old church's,white vinyl siding,
waiting for the train,so many shades of orange,in the maple tree,
autumn night,not nearly enough,stars to count,
winter rush hour --,brake lights bleed,through clouds of exhaust,
folding my pizza,olive oil presses,my wrinkled shirt,
watching Jackie Chan,I kick at my shadow,and miss,
6th and Wabasha --,waiting with ghosts,for a taxicab,
my half-empty bed --,still giving you,plenty of space...,
smiling in his sleep,my little cricket chaser,
missing the comet,I slowly recede,beyond the horizon,
first day of school,the empty pages,of her notebook,
this bitter ale,the color of sunset,
perilously close,to the third rail,a runaway snowflake,
a homeless man sleeps,on Sunday's obituaries,
talking to herself,the old woman's eyes,never leave me,
catching my glance,the waitress discards,some freshly dropped toast,
visiting Grandma's grave,I can almost smell,her arroz con pollo,
overcast sky --,still feeling,last night's beer,
staring,at a sheet of paper -,a night without words,
swirling,with each oar stroke,the moon's reflection,
moonless night --,the barmaid,calls me &quot;honey&quot;,
first date --,under the streetlight,our shadows hold hands,
unlike me,tonight's mosquitoes,have no desire to sleep,
drinking alone --,the pale moon,in a starless sky,
the install team,orders another catered meal --,tasteless and extra crispy,
missing my bus,the baby sleeps,in her mother's arms,
warm December night,pub windows decorated,with spraycan snow,
waiting for the bus,I remember your shoulders,shivering,
winter sun --,and I still want,to sleep on the train,
late night install --,the empty coffee pot,still burning,
our last full day --,finishing another stout,I try to drink it all in,
stripper,yawning,rhythmically,
approaching storm --,a cloud,of seagulls,
late summer night --,the amber haze,of too much beer,
waiting for her call ,I stare ,at thunderclouds,
sake on an empty stomach,- a haiku headache,
thank you,for the gift of yourself,unwrapped,
the thaw continues,road salt,and spiked heels,
stung,by a stiff March breeze,I remember you,
two wine glasses ,one empty - the other ,overflowing,
Memorial Drive --,rollerblading,into pigeons,
through the bare tree branches,our neighbor's ugly paint job,
unemployment line --,sunlight fills a scratch,in the plexiglass window,
the decision,at Canal and Mulberry:,pasta or tofu?,
all alone,in the Texas sky,crescent moon,
frog,pond,- splash!,
first day of Spring --,pressing against a tight sweater,her erect nipples,
unable to escape,the subway station,of my dreams,
as I wake up,the soothing rumble,of a cat purring,
passing the freight yard,an unhitched engine,covered with leaves,
in this notebook,scribbles, cross-outs,and the smell of beer,
between Christmas and New Year's,the fireplace glows,with gift wrap,
ex-mother-in-law,preaching,to my outstretched phone,
through the snow,on my televison set --,hurricane warnings,
all night long,the silence,of clouds,
low tide,at Hermosa Beach pier,another crack deal,
forgetting the day,at the bottom of this pint,
the sunset,from my office window,the long drive home,
even after three beers,the jukebox,won't play my song,
the night grandma died,I finally notice,my father's accent,
steam from a tea bag,another cold morning,
waiting for the train,I clutch,my ice cold coffee,
punching a hole,through the Soho night -,amber moon,
suddenly,remembering my children,my blurred reflection,
alone at Alewife station,the tired moan,of the last train,
walking alone,I crave,the impending drizzle,
on the escalator,socialites,ascending,
the ultimate independence:,eating ramen from the pot,
another night ,in search of ,exploding stars,
Hermosa Beach,two women on rollerblades,pushing baby strollers,
another starless night,drinking,the darkness,
nearing forty,I finally notice,the day lilies,
wine and chocolate ,without words you sense ,my intoxication,
summer mist,the softness,of her skin,
her bright blue bikini,matching her lips --,the drowning victim,
more snow flurries --,my hair grows greyer,before my eyes,
the bottle,spins,me,
first snowfall --,bare branches and commuters,tremble at the station,
Thanksgiving rain,sparrows take shelter,beneath the evergreen,
trapped,inside my pen,this haiku,
New Year's Day,a graveyard,of Christmas trees,
while donating blood,the steady rhythm,of my clenching fist,
the way he sips his espresso,it can't be bitter enough,
punishing,my Sunday hangover,church bells,
brightening the evening sky,the memory of your smile,
full moon,the midnight sheen,of her stockings,
biker bar:,strangers compare tattoos,
asleep on the train,one more golden leaf,falls to the ground,
thinking of you,I step ankle deep,into a slush puddle,
the newlywed:,even on business trips,he puts the seat down,
the Admitting desk,waiting for my name,to be mispronounced,
Sunday hangover,no match,for my mother's pancakes,
this Corona,the color of sunrise,
windy night --,while two lovers kiss,the streetlight winks,
somewhere,beyond these skyscrapers,a pale yellow sun,
at the fabric store,picking out a dye,for that wedding dress,
breakfast on the Strand --,a man and his surfboard,
a rocker's dilemma:,to flee or to catch,the crowd surfers?,
working late again,the dinner I missed,simmering,
a pair of socks,my daughter left behind --,September fog,
September fog --,the soft lights,of the morning train,
pouring the champagne,effervescent,ocean wave,
in a corner of the restaurant,a cat concentrates,on sleep,
a few yellow leaves,cling to the old maple --,warm November morning,
hugging her,oh so close,faded jeans,
Stillwater morning --,jasmine blossoms,covered with frost,
acid jazz saxophone,also incoherent,after three beers,
at the foot of Sears Tower,a collarless dog,drinks from a puddle,
reflecting candlelight,her bedroom eyes            ,
the last day of April --,finally I put away,the snow shovel,
Hermosa morning --,mothers in rollerblades,pushing strollers,
long distance to my children ,hearing only Nickelodeon,
scattering,as my lips draw near,dandelion seeds,
the old oak tree --,my initials,twenty feet high,
shooting star --,the taste,of our first kiss,
no longer,strawberry bubblegum,my daughter's perfume,
she seems,so flat and pale,in newsprint,
celebrating the new job,with a bitter ale,
my daughter's birthday --,a mourning dove basks,in the September sun,
snow changes to rain,too many weeks,between visits with my children,
fresh from the recycle bin,a homeless man,reads yesterday's horoscope,
closing my eyes,my face in the mirror,-- still wrinkled,
you finally arrive,through my open window,-- jasmine dreams,
breakfast with a friend,smiling,in the cold rain,
on the late train,a boy too tired to cry,-- freezing drizzle,
too tired to cry --,freezing drizzle,
shivering,the full moon,beneath a veil of snow,
hot summer day --,my sweat,tastes like beer,
Sunday morning,the subway entrance,crowded with pigeons,
those dark sunglasses --,can she see me,staring at her?,
after the storm,raindrops cling,to spider webs,
decorating,the bare white window frame,a ladybug,
stormy weather,on Wall Street:,a blizzard of ticker tape,
unrecognized,by an old friend,clouds without rain,
hiding,in the unmowed grass --,undercover cows,
caressing her thighs,the sweater she knits,for somebody else,
approaching thunder ,the crows ,are no longer laughing,
warm November day,golfers rake the 7th green,with their putters,
church bells,punish,my Sunday hangover,
reflected,in quiet puddles --,darkening clouds,
from his cage,a morning dove calls,into the night,
bare tree branches,rake,the November sky,
Harvard Square panhandler,lets me pass by,
suburban lullaby - ,the steady din ,of the freeway,
while you are gone,the evergreens are weeping,slow melting snow,
rush hour traffic,my second cup of coffee,is cold,
approaching the mountain ,the airplane's shadow,rises,
my seven year-old,finally beats up the bully,in red crayon,
smothering the shadows ,black sheets of rain,
her long blonde hair,is darker at the roots,than mine once was,
after the ice storm,even my car,glistens,
at the flea market,a gold wedding band,priced for quick sale,
Texas heat --,the glistening legs,of the barmaid,
casting a shadow,across my kitchen table --,a stack of bills,
stranger than fiction,she thanks me for flowers,I didn't send,
piercing,the perfect lips,a shining diamond,
St. Patrick's Day --,a bicycle courier,with his dreadlocks dyed green,
a baseball cap,floats in the puddle --,wind-blown clouds,
turkey leftovers,the wishbone,is already broken,
no place to go,no desire,to come in from the rain,
another warm day,the lingering taste,of her lipstick,
your angry words -,relentless,thunder,
New England summer,the sun shines bright,somewhere beyond this haze,
April sunlight,glitters in my hair --,the color of clouds,
Christmas Eve,I hold the bus,for Santa,
at the bookstore,a frugal shopper,reading haiku,
a beer,before my doctor's appointment,the lingering taste of pain,
asleep on the train,my wrist watch,still keeps perfect time,
warm October day --,putting away ,the air conditioner,
the Monday before Christmas,I watch my coffee grow cold,
city lights,softening,the moon,
reading Kafka ,I pause ,to kill a fly,
ignoring,rush hour traffic,I avoid the ice puddle,
peace in Sarajevo,loading the wardrobe,onto the truck,
she searches,for Mr. Right,through a golden ale,
the morning after --,valentine's day roses,at half price,
on Lowry Hill,Sunday brunch,and salsa,
my eyes open ,was it your kiss ,or the sparrow's song?,
unable to sleep,infomercials,in the hotel lounge,
pushing his cart,the old man shops,for empty cans,
between the dumpster,and the construction crane,a sidewalk blues jam,
after singing all day,the mockingbird,sounds even louder now,
January wind,the streetlights,shiver,
black ice --,even with the heat on,I shiver,
autumn breeze --,I can wait one more day,to rake leaves,
cool September night,the cry of the locust,my son's sleepy smile,
Harvard Square,the street musician's,shiny new guitar,
a dusting of snow --,my last beer remains,unopened,
renegade breeze --,leaves return,to a well-raked lawn,
after the storm,rainbows,in street puddles,
first frost --,time to take in,the plastic flamingo,
crossing her legs,she stirs her yogurt,with a plastic spoon,
Monday morning,only the jack o'lanterns,are smiling,
church bells,slightly,off-key,
distant thunder --,the deepening darkness,of your eyes,
St. Patrick's Day,suburban lawns,still brownish grey,
naked mannequin,by the frozen dumpster,-- a sudden shiver,
waiting for the train,every day,my shadow lengthens,
sleepless night --,snow turns to sleet,and back again,
squeezing from my pillow,the fading fragrance,of your hair,
finally relaxed,I dream,of the next hectic day,
reading Basho,between infomercials,
interrupting,my haiku meditation,to kill a yellow jacket,
already hot this morning,I am trying not to talk,to her cleavage,
seeing my reflection,as if expecting,someone else,
my wife's birthday --,I finally find,the perfect rose,
snow in the air,the taste,of road salt,
this morning coffee,never warm enough,to melt the snow,
approaching storm,a tree filled with blackbirds,silent,
emerging from its nest,with a mighty roar,the construction crane,
gazing into ,an open field ,daydreaming of trains,
running late for work,I watch my daughters sleep,
sand between my toes,dissolving before my eyes --,the sound of waves,
Navy Pier,the classic merry-go-round,of your smile,
spring rain,awakens,the jasmine petals,
the Fenway crowd,applauds a diving catch,in the bleachers,
Porter Square serenade,between trains,
freezing rain --,the tree branches break,so beautifully,
South Station,a string quartet,serenades the Christmas tree,
a part in the clouds,your smile,reflected in raindrops,
first snowfall,reaching for the camera,before the shovel,
uncoiling,at the end of your cigarette,your lips,
at 6'10&quot; he gently bends,to let his mother,wipe his mouth,
awake all night,my hallucinations dissolve,into coffee,
waiting for the bus,wishing it would matter,if I were late,
a warm day in March,snow and clothing,melt away,
before the rain,the absence,of mourning doves,
beneath the frost,the rose,that will not die,
October rain --,she fine tunes her lipstick,on the Worcester express,
overcast day,the ventilator,silent,
tipping,the taxi driver,the last train pulls away,
Boston fog --,the cold medicine,kicks in,
Seney Stretch --,between this blinking light and the next,nothing but miles,
turning back the clock --,what to do,with that extra hour?,
looking not at all festive:,Christmas trees,on a flat-bed truck,
after the storm,dueling snow plows,
washing down,your angry words,with this bitter ale,
carrying an umbrella,knowing it will never rain,
waves crash on the beach,my grandmother's wrinkles,in the sand,
held just right,the sea wind whistles in the mouth,of an empty beer bottle,
ashes on forehead,she lights another cigarette,
windless night --,even in my dreams,the scent of jasmine,
windless autumn night --,the sudden gust,of a passing freight train,
a dew drop clings,to an autumn leaf --,your golden earrings,
waiting for the train,so many,gray tangled clouds,
rush hour --,clutching the wheel,and my first cup of coffee,
long and dark,autumn shadows,and her legs,
Galveston midnight:,the bay reflects,the refineries' glow,
where I last saw your face,a cold lakefront wind,
St. Patrick's Day,washing down my ramen,with a pint of Guinness,
sleeping on my doorstep,the black and white cat,who isn't a cat,
seeing its reflection,the sparrow narrowly avoids,my window,
winter rain --,in an empty parking lot,a pay phone rings,
crying,all night long,the wind,
passing train: ,the ice cubes in my glass ,become wind chimes,
the plane lifts off ,sudden thunder ,and a trail of words,
the view from my window:,miles of empty sky,
another all-nighter:,the caffeine-enhanced glow,of sunrise,
summer's last stand --,waiting for the breeze,of a passing train,
after the rain,my old beat-up van,covered with lilacs,
crowded elevator,a fatal clash,of perfumes,
the old church,wears a sign:,&quot;now leasing&quot;,
after one too many,the run in her stocking,scowls at me,
morning walk --,your words,in the wind,
Minnesota spring --,the geese return,to a frozen pond,
writing this poem,on the 6:21 train,the conductor sleeps,
leaving the candy machine,having achieved,Almond Joy,
overheated car ,ignored ,by the rage of traffic,
running a red light,so that I can wait,in the last parking space,
still clinging --,a lone dandelion seed,
awakened by lightning,without thunder,the blinking streetlamp,
adult book store,a refuge,from church bells,
Wednesday morning --,another day to pass,the unfinished mural,
reassuringly,locating,the distress bag,
another long night,dreaming of dark ale,and rain,
entering South Station,sunlight glistens,on construction cranes,
overcast night,shouting directions,at the taxi driver,
wrong turn,down a dead-end street,irises in bloom,
etched in chalk:,join the fencing team,no experience needed,
mixed in with the junk mail,my ex-wife's therapy bills,
late for the train,but more importantly,my morning bagel,
April rain --,clinging to my face,a smile,
after the storm ,each droplet on my window ,a rainbow,
every night ,I watch her silhouette ,practice kata,
I curse this window,and another,parking lot breakup,
summer evening --,an old dog chases hubcaps,in his sleep,
on the early train,a student reads her textbook,with both eyes closed,
leaving suburbia,sunlight clings,to evergreens,
smoke spirals,from burning leaves,and it's only Thursday...,
waxing eloquent,your long legs...,
on either side,of the Mass Pike,wild flowers,
rainbow,stalked,by funnel clouds,
sunny day,obscured by clouds,on the X-ray,
November sun --,a startled snowman,drops his pipe,
eggs juxtapositioned,with veggies out of season:,a Western omelet,
six months later,this old guitar,is still in tune,
military jet,carves a white scar,in the sky,
July overcast,I have forgotten,my umbrella,
found: one roll ,of photographs ,I don't remember,
another late night,I watch as the taxi driver,passes my street,
sleepless night,the whistling nose,of the cat,
reflected,in your dark brown eyes,another shooting star,
late afternoon,following a shaft of sunlight,between skyscrapers,
awakened by ,the lilac breeze ,of perfume,
its thorns,rip my fingers --,the perfect white rose,
a train passes --,I remember,the taste of your lips,
after the storm,native Bostonians,still carry their umbrellas,
where we once walked,an overgrown path,
alone in Texas,the cold spot,on her side of the bed,
all alone,in the thickening overcast,harvest moon,
february sun,shimmering,on frozen puddles,
lighting a cigarette,the burn victim,
Manhattan snowfall:,boots instead of sneakers,with business suits,
glittering,with morning dew --,deadly nightshade,
calling my son on his birthday,the phone rings unanswered,
in the heat of day,the spider's web,is empty,
my son waves goodbye,the window,streaming with rain,
stopping traffic,her tight black miniskirt,
gifts finally wrapped,a piece of tinsel,follows the cat,
taking an earlier train,the fogged-up windows,of a donut shop,
busy intersection --,reflected in her eyes,the blinking red light,
no end to this heat ,the fireflies are drunk ,on afternoon haze,
happy hour over,my life's story,interrupted,
along the Charles,a pair of ducks,swims past the bus,
spring snow,melting,into tulip blossoms,
winter fog,feeling the absence,of crickets,
mid crossword --,fluttering past my eye,your red dress,
my pet firefly ,motionless in his jar ,a starless sky,
nothing personal, little frog,but I prefer to shower alone,
first day of June,withering dandelions,
the leaves change color --,my three older children,unable to visit me ,
first frost,an empty spider web,
the pouncing cat,chases you,from my dream,
alone again,this dark ale,and me,
approaching storm,she sees me glancing,at her legs,
whitewashing the stars,the full moon smiles,at two young lovers,
Minnesota-bound:,the smell of fresh pizza,twelve hundred miles away,
automatic door opens,for a pair of pigeons,
you ask me,what I'm thinking --,snow changes to rain,
basking ,in the glow ,of Doppler radar,
lining up,at the knotty pine bar,regulars and their children,
imminent storm ,I can feel ,the darkness,
driving my children           ,to the ferry,a deep purple sunset,
last-minute lunch,the ATM,eats my card,
in the window ,a cat stalks ,her reflection ,
spiked heels,stab,the April snow,
warm October day,-- but the dragonflies know,that summer is over,
spring breeze,the refreshing sensation,of her thighs,
Minnesota sunshine --,diamonds,in street puddles,
October rain --,a blanket,of wet leaves,
soft pink,cherry blossoms,against my lips,
restless night --,streetlight reflected,in the cat's eyes,
wrapped around each arpeggio,the guitarist's cigarette smoke,
Port Jefferson ferry,unloads its cargo:,cigarette perfume,
holiday gridlock --,evening fog,settles in,
mouse droppings:,at least I know,I am not alone,
August morning,making love to you,to the music of rain,
do these minnows know ,the tidal pool ,is receding?,
with callused hands,a homeless man,keeps his pants up,
artist's bedroom --,four bare walls,and a mattress,
Kenmore Square,impromptu waterfall,down the subway steps,
field of snow --,another unwritten haiku,
too busy sleeping ,to notice the rain,
Christmas with my children --,mending broken toys,
winter sun --,the office administrator,in a miniskirt,
Placencia beach,a rooster crows,in the cool of night,
leaning forward,but not quite reaching,the daddy long legs,
a seagull cries --,why am I going to work,on a beautiful day?,
Venice Beach ,body builders ,can't stop the rain,
street musicians,lip-synching,-- a passing bus,
approaching train,a rat,abandons its breakfast,
crowded brewpub,unable to hear,these words,
Allston train yard --,dandelions encircle,the old caboose,
not a cure for pain,this beer nonetheless,dilutes my tears,
waiting for the train,a swirl of dogwood petals,
distant thunder --,suddenly a cloud,of sparrows,
interview day - ,meandering trails ,of perfume,
waiting for surgery,the orderlies,pace,
caressing her face,while she sleeps on the Green Line,skyscraper shadows,
fresh spraypaint,on the supermarket dumpster:,&quot;Jesus Saves&quot;,
my daughters' plane departs,a plume of white smoke,lingers,
on a park bench,he rehearses,his breakup speech,
in the hallway,the laces of our shoes,intertwined,
sunny day ,I mimic ,the mockingbird,
watching the hailstorm,I order my drink,without ice,
unwilling,to do more than gaze,at the winter rain,
now arriving,at South Station,a cold November wind,
circles,from my beer mug,frame this haiku,
watching her smile,when she says,&quot;it's our honeymoon&quot;,
up past midnight,guiltily,watching &quot;Cops&quot;,
hot summer morning --,this time the conductor,lets me catch the train,
toast,hangover,toast,
the Plough and Stars,new friends and old memories,share a pint,
handshake or embrace?,circling above the clouds,awaiting clearance...,
minutes before,October arrives,I remember summer,
eighteen days,before Christmas --,slow steady rain,
entering South Station,the construction cranes don't care,that it's snowing,
tree branches snap,in the cold wind --,I clutch my back,
a hawk circles above ,ignoring the traffic ,or perhaps stalking it,
McSorley's Old Ale House,sharing a beer,with my memories,
bombs fall in Baghdad,and here I am hoping,it doesn't snow,
November morning --,fox prints,in the fresh snow,
the Dow drops,but mother spider,keeps spinning her web,
an evening with,the bachelor poet --,beer and haiku,
on this bitter cold day,the bright sun mocks,
rushing to work,I take the time,to kick a pebble,
yes, there is a heaven,Placencia moonlight,in your eyes,
sunshine returns,I can't remember,where I last left my shades,
emerging,from the Caribbean,a blood red moon,
a rude awakening -,frost on my windshield,
Korean War monument,decorated,with withered flowers,
so busy,this hot afternoon,the hummingbird,
Boston fog --,the gentle glow,of the Citgo sign,
content to wander,and yet so weary --,cold autumn rain,
passing the cemetery,I succumb to the urge,to buy flowers,
still wearing,yesterday's makeup,her coffee grows cold,
the long walk,from the train station,to your embrace,
the still pool --,a frog jumps,into itself,
winter thaw --,my gloves,are not far away,
moonless night --,the deepening darkness,of your eyes,
the Cold War lives,I curse,at a game of Tetris,
my two warring cats,snuggling in their sleep,
at the pawn shop ,a tarnished wedding band ,priced for quick sale,

firmly planted,in the greenhouse,a pink flamingo,
Battery Park,Statue of Liberty,in your eyes,
shopping for the ring,my car's brakes,are squealing,
by coincidence,the pillow beside me,also wears your perfume,

dew,clinging,to September,
under the ceiling fan,our kisses melt,into lovemaking,
in the country silence,I dream of trains,

just outside my window,the world's loudest bird,

overnight flurries --,the ominous glow,of sunrise,
the pavement and I,smoldering,in airport traffic,
5 p.m. -,the darkening shadow,on my face,
the end of August,shiny new lunch boxes,lined up on the curb,
listening to the News,I feel guilty,for being alive,
pondering,the OJ verdict,I think of my ex-wife,

in the alleyway,broken glass,and well-fed cats,
