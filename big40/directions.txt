From the Pike-  Take Exit 13, Natick.  Go thru the tolls and bear left.  You will be heading in the correct direction on Rte 30.  Go for 1 mile (You will pass The Home Depot and Lake Cochituate during the mile).  You will come to a set of lights at Rte 30 and Rte 27.  Take a right onto Rte 27.  There will be a big yellow bldg on your right that contains a Starbucks and Especially For Pets.  Right after the parking lot for the building (almost immediately after you turn onto 27) take a right onto Cormans Lane....it is easy to miss the road...it is DIRECTLY ACROSS RTE 27 FROM THE SUNOCO STATION.  It is a little dead end, dirt road.  We are the first house on the right.....tall blue/gray with black shutters.  #9.  

Number to call if you are lost:  (508) 652-0230.  

If there are lots of cars parked in front of the house please park in the Starbuck’s parking lot.
