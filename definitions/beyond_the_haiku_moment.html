What does North American haiku look like when observed from Japan?
What kind of advice might haiku masters such as Basho and Buson give
to English haiku poets?  What would Basho and Buson say if they were
alive today and could read English and could read haiku done by North
American poets?
<p>
I think that they would be delighted to find that haiku had managed to
cross the Pacific and thrive so far from its place of origin.  They would
be impressed with the wide variety of haiku composed by North American
haiku poets and find their work most innovative.  At the same time, however, 
they would also be struck, as I have been, by the narrow definitions of
haiku found in haiku handbooks, magazines, and anthologies.  I was once
told that Ezra Pound's famous metro poem first published in 1913, was 
not haiku.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
The apparation of these faces in the crowd:<br>
Petals on a wet, black bough .</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
If I remember correctly, the reason for disqualification was that the metro
poem was not about nature as we know it and that the poem was fictional or
imaginary.  Pound's poem may also have been ruled out since it uses an
obvious metaphor: the petals are a metaphor for the apparition of the faces,
or vice versa.  This view of the metro poem was based on the three key 
definitions of haiku - haiku is about direct observation, haiku eschews
metaphor, and haiku is about nature - which poets such as Basho and Buson
would have seriously disputed.
<p>
</blockquote><center>
<strong>
Haiku as Direct Personal Experience or Observation
</strong>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
One of the widespread beliefs in North America is that haiku should be 
based upon one's own direct experience, that it must derive from one's own 
observations, particularly of nature.  But it is important to remember that
this is basically a modern view of haiku, the result, in part, of nineteenth
century European realism, which had an impact on modern Japanese haiku and
then was re-imported back to the West as something very Japanese.  Basho,
who wrote in the seventeenth century, would have not made such a distinction
between direct personal experience and the imaginary, nor would he have
placed higher value on fact over fiction.
<p>
Basho was first and foremost a master of haikai, or comic linked poetry.
In haikai lined verse, the seventeen syllable hokku, or opening verse, is
followed by a 14 syllable <i>wakiku</i>, or added verse, which in turn is followed
by the seventeen syllable third verse, and so forth.  Except for the first
verse, which stood alone, each additional verse was read together with the
previous verse and pushed away from the penultimate verse, or the verse
prior to the previous verse.  Thus, the first and second verse, the second
and third verse, third and fourth verse formed independent units, each of
which pushed off from the previous unit.
<p>
The joy and pleasure of <i>haikai</i> was that it was imaginary literature, 
that the poets who participated in linked verse moved from one world to the
next, across time, and across space.  The basic idea of linked verse was to
create a new and unexpected world out of the world of the previous verse.
Once could compose about one's daily life, about being an official in China,
about being a warrior in the medieval period, or an aristocrat in the ancient
period.  The other participants in the haikai sequence joined you in that
imaginary world or took you to places that you could reach on with your
imagination.
<p>
One of the reasons that linked verse became so popular in the late medieval
period, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when it first blossomed
as a genre, was because it was a form of escape from the terrible wars that
ravaged the country at the time.  For samurai in the era of constant war, 
linked verse was like the tea ceremony; it allowed one to escape, if only
for a brief time, from the world at large, from all the bloodshed.  The joy
of it was that one could do that in the close company of friends and 
companions. When the verse sequence was over, one came back to earth, to 
reality.  The same occurred in the tea ceremony as developed by Sen no Rikyu.
The tea hut took one away from the cares of this world, together with one's
friends and companions.
<p>
In short, linked verse, both orthodox linked verse <i>(renga)</i> and its comic
or casual version <i>(haikai)</i>, was fundamentally imaginary.  The hokku, or
opening verse of the <i>haikai</i> sequence, which later became haiku, required
a seasonal word, which marked the time and place of the gathering, but it too
had no restrictions with regard to the question of fiction.  Indeed, poets
often composed on fixed topics <i>(dai)</i>, which were established in advance.
Buson, one of the great poets of haiku of the late eighteenth century, was in
fact very much a studio or desk poet.  He composed his poetry at home, in his
study, and he often wrote about other worlds, particularly the tenth and
eleventh century Heian aristocratic world and the subsequent medieval period.
One of his most famous historical poems is <i>Tobadono e gorokki isogu mowaki
kana</i>, probably composed in 1776.  (All translations are my own.)
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
To Toba palace<br>
5 or 6 horsemen hurry<br>
autumn tempest</i>
<p>
</center> <blockquote>
Toba palace, which immediately sets this in the Heian or early medieval
period, was an imperial villa that the Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa (1053 - 
1129) constructed near Kyoto in the eleventh century and that subsequently
became the location of a number of political and military conspiracies.
The galloping horsemen are probably warriors on some emergency mission -
a sense of turmoil and urgency embodied in the season word of autumn tempest
<i>(nowaki)</i>.  An American equivalent might be something like the 
Confederate cavalry at Gettysburg during the Civil War or the militia at
Lexington during the American revolution.  The hokku creates a powerful
atmosphere and a larger sense of narrative, like a scene from a medieval
military epic or from a picture scroll.
<p>
Another noted historical poem by Buson is <i>Komabune no yorade sugiyuku
kasumi kana</i>, composed in 1777.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
the Korean ship<br>
not stopping passes back<br>
into the mist</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
Komabune were the large Korean ships that sailed to Japan during the ancient
period, bringing cargo and precious goods from the continent, a practice 
that had long since been discontinued by Buson's time.  The Korean ship,
which is offshore, appears to be heading for port but then gradually 
disappears into the mist <i>(kasumi)</i>, a seasonal word for spring and
one associated with dream-like atmosphere.  The Korean ship passing into
the spring mist creates a sense of mystery, of a romantic other, making the
viewer wonder if this scene is nothing but a dream.
<p>
Another example from Buson is <i>inazuma ya nami moteyueru akitsushima</i>,
composed in 1776.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
lightning --<br>
girdled by waves<br>
islands of Japan</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
In this hokku, the light from the lightning <i>(inazuma)</i>, a seasonal
word for autumn associated in the ancient period with the rice harvest
<i>(ina)</i>, enables the viewer to see the waves surrounding all the
islands of Akitsushima (an anceint name for Japan that originally meant
the islands where rice grows richly).  This is not the result of direct
experience.  It is a spectacular aerial view - a kind of paean to the
fertility and beauty of the country - that would only be possible from
far above the earth.
<p>
Even the personal poems can be imaginary.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
piercingly cold<br>
stepping on my dead wife's comb<br>
in the bedroom</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
The opening phrase, <i>mini ni shimu</i> (literally, to penetrate the body),
is an autumn phrase that suggests the chill and sense of loneliness that sinks
into the body with the arrival of the autumn cold and that here also functions
as a metaphor of the poet's feelings following the death of his wife.  The
poem generates a novelistic scene of the widower, some time after his wife's
funeral, accidentally stepping on a comb in the autumn dark, as he is about
to go to bed alone.  The standard interpretation is that the snapping of the
comb in the bedroom brings back memories of their relationship and has erotic
overtones.  But this is not about direct or personal experience.  The fact is
that Buson (1706-83) composed this while his wife was alive.  Indeed Buson's
wife Tomo outlived him by 31 years.
<p>
Why then the constant emphasis by North American haiku poets on direct
personal experience?  The answer to this is historically complex, but it
should be noted that the haikai that preceded Basho was almost entirely
imaginary or fictionaly haikai.  Much of it was so imaginary that it was
absurd, and as a result it was criticized by some as "nonsense" haikai.
A typical example is the following hokku found in <i>Indoshu</i> (Teaching
collection, 1684), a Danrin school haikai handbook: <i>mine no hana no nami
ni ashika kujira o oyogase.</i>
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
making sea lions and whales<br>
swim in the cherry blossom waves<br>
at the hill top</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
The hokku links cherry blossoms, which were closely associated with waves
and hill tops in classical Japanese poetry, to sea lions and whales, two
non-classical, vernacular words, thereby comically deconstructing the poetic
cliche of "waves of cherry blossoms".  Basho was one of the critics of this
kind of "nonsense" haikai.  He believed that haikai should describe the
world "as it is".  He was in fact part of a larger movement that was a
throwback to earlier orthodox linked verse or renga.  However, to describe
the world as it is did not mean denying fiction.  Fiction can be very
realistic and even more real than life itself.  For Basho, it was necessary
to experience everyday life, to travel, to expose oneself to the world as
much as possible, so that the poet could reveal the world as it was.  But
it could also be fictional, something born of the imagination.  In fact,
you had to use your imagination to compose haikai, since it was very much
about the ability to move from one world to another.  Basho himself often
rewrote his poetry: he would change the gender, the place, the time, the
situation.  The only thing that mattered was the effectiveness of the poetry,
not whether it was faithful to the original experience.
<p>
One of the chief reasons for the emphasis in modern Japan on direct personal
observations was Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902), the late nineteenth century pioneer
of modern haiku, who stressed the sketch <i>(shasei)</i> based on direct
observation of the subject as the key to the composition of the modern haiku.
This led to the <i>ginko</i>, the trips to places to compose haiku.  Shiki
denounced linked verse as an intellectual game and saw the haiku as an
expression of the individual.  In this regard Shiki was deeply influenced by
Western notions of literature and poetry; first, that literature should be
realistic, and second, that literature should be an expression of the 
individual.  By contrast, haikai as Basho had known it had been largely
imaginary, and had been a communal activity, the product of group composition
or exchange.  Shiki condemned traditional haikai on both counts.  Even if Shiki
had not existed, the effect would have been similar since Western influence on 
Japan from the late 19th century has been massive.  Early American and British 
pioneers of English-language haiku - such as Basil Chamberlain, Harold 
Henderson, R.H. Blyth - had limited interest in modern Japanese haiku, but
shared may of Shiki's assumptions.  The influence of Ezra Pound and the 
(Anglo-American) Modernist poetry movement was also significant in shaping
modern notions of haiku.  In short, what many North American haiku poets have
thought to be uniquely Japanese had in fact its roots in Western literary 
thought.
<p>
We are often told, particularly by the pioneers of English language haiku
(such as D.T. Suzuki, Alan Watts, and the Beats) who mistakenly emphasized
Zen Buddhism in Japanese haiku, that haiku should be about the "here and 
now".  This is an extension of the notion that haiku must derive from direct 
observation and personal experience.  Haiku is extremely short, and therefore
it can concentrate on only a few details.  It is thus suitable for focusing
on the here and now.  But there is no reason why these moments have to be
only in the present, contemporary world or why haiku can't deal with other
kinds of time.  This noted haiku appears in Basho's <i>Narrow Road: samidare
no furinokoshite ya hikarido.</i><p>
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
Have the summer rains<br>
come and gone, sparing<br>
the Hall of Light
<p>
</i></center>
<blockquote>
The summer rains (<i>samidare</i>) refers both to the rains falling now and
to past summer rains, which have spared the Hall of Light over the centuries.
Perhaps Basho's most famous poem in <i>Narrow Road</i> is <i>natsukusa ya
tsuwamonodomo ga yume no ato</i> in which the "dreams" and the "summer
grasses" are both those of the contemporary poet and of the warriors of the
distant past.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
Summer grasses --<br>
traces of dreams<br>
of ancient warriors
<p>
</i></center>
<blockquote>
As we can see from these examples, haiku moments can occur in the distant
past or in distant, imaginary places.  In fact, one of Buson's great
accomplishments was his ability to create other worlds.
<p>
Basho traveled to explore the present, the contemporary world, to meet new
poets, and to compose linked verse together.  Equally important, travel was
a means of entering into the past, of meeting the spirits of the dead, of
experiencing what his poetic and spiritual predecessors had experienced.
In other words, there were two key axes: one horizontal, the present, the
comtemporary world; and the other vertical, leading back into the past, to
history, to other poems.  As I have shown in my book <i>Traces of Dreams:
Landscape, Cultural Memory, and the Poetry of Basho</i>, Basho believed that
the poet had to work along both axes.  To work only in the present would 
result in poetry that was fleeting.  To work just in the past, on the other
hand, would be to fall out of touch with the fundamental nature of haikai,
which was rooted in the everyday world.  Haikai was, by definition, anti-
traditional, anti-classical, anti-establishment, but that did not mean that 
it rejected the past.  Rather, it depended upon the past and on earlier texts
and associations for its richness.
<p>
If Basho and Buson were to look at North American haiku today, they would 
see the horizontal axis, the focus on the present, on the contemporary
world, but they would probably feel that the vertical axis, the movement
across time, was largely missing.  There is no problem with the English
language haiku handbooks that stress personal experience.  They should.
This is a good way to practice, and it is an effective and simple way of
getting many people involved in haiku.  I believe, as Basho did, that direct
experience and direct observation is absolutely critical; it is the base
from which we must work and which allows us to mature into interesting poets.
However, as the examples of Basho and Buson suggest, it should not dictate
either the direction or value of haiku.  It is the beginning, not the end.
Those haiku that are fictional or imaginary are just as valid as those that
are based on personal experience.  I would in fact urge the composition of
what might be called historical haiku or science fiction haiku.
<p>
</blockquote><center>
<strong>
Haiku as Non-metaphorical
</strong>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
Another rule of North American haiku that Basho would probably find
discomforting is the idea that haiku eschews metaphor and allegory.
North American haiku handbooks and magazines stress that haiku should be
concrete, that it should be about the thing itself.  The poet does not
use one object or idea to describe another, using A to understand B, as
in simile or metaphor; instead the poet concentrates on the object itself.
Allegory, in which a set of signs or symbols draw a parallel between one
world and the next, is equally shunned.  All three of these techniques - 
metaphor, simile, and allegory - are generally considered to be taboo in
English-language haiku, and beginners are taught not to use them.
<p>
However, many of Basho's haiku use metaphor and allegory, and in fact this
is probably one of the most important aspects of his poetry.  In Basho's
time, one of the most important functions of the hokku, or opening verse,
which was customarily composed by the guest, was to greet the host of the
session or party.  The hokku had to include a seasonal word, to indicate
the time, but it also had to compliment the host.  This was often done 
allegorically or symbolically, by describing some aspect of nature, which
implicitly resembled the host.  A good example is: <i>shiragiku no me ni
tatete miru chiri mo nashi:</i>
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
gazing intently<br>
at the white chrysanthemums --<br>
not a speck of dust</i>
</center><blockquote>
<p>
Here Basho is complementing the host (Sonome), represented by the white
chrysanthemums, by stressing the flower's and, by implication, Sonome's
purity.
<p>
Another example is <i>botan shibe fukaku wakeizuru hachi no nagori kana,</i>
which appears in Basho's travel diary <i>Skeleton in the Fields (Nozarashi
kiko)</i>.
<p>
Having stayed once more at the residence of Master Toyo, I was about to leave
for the Eastern Provinces.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
from deep within<br>
the peony pistils -- withdrawing<br>
regretfully the bee</i>
</center><blockquote>
<p>
In this parting poem the be represents Basho and the peony pistils the host
(Master Toyo).  The bee leaves the flower only with the greatest reluctance,
thus expressing the visitor's deep gratitude to the host.  This form of
symbolism or simple allegory was standard for poets at this time, as it was
for the entire poetic tradition.  In classical Japanese poetry, object of
nature inevitably serve as symbols or signs for specific individuals or
situations in the human world, and Japanese haikai is no exception.  
Furthermore, poets like Basho and Buson repeatedly used the same images 
(such as the rose for Buson or the beggar for Basho) to create complex
metaphors and symbols.
<p>
It is no doubt a good idea for the beginner to avoid overt metaphor or
allegory or symbolism, but this should not be the rule for more advanced
poets.  In fact, I think this rule prevents many good poets from becoming
great poets.  Without the use of metaphor, allegory and symbolism, haiku
will have a hard time achieveing the complexity and depth necessary to
become the object of serious study and commentary.  The fundamental difference
between the use of metaphor in haiku and that in other poetry is that in haiku
it tends to be extremely subtle and indirect, to the point of not being 
readily apparent.  The metaphor in good haiku is often buried deep within 
the poem.  For example, the seasonal word in Japanese haiku tends often to be
inherently metaphorical, since it bears very specific literary and cultural
associations, but the first and foremost function of the seasonal word is
descriptive, leaving the metaphorical dimension implied.
<p>
</blockquote><center>
<strong>
Allusion, Poetry about Poetry
</strong>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
The emphasis on the "haiku moment" in North American haiku has meant that
most of the poetry does not have another major characteristic of Japanese
haikai and haiku: its allusive charcter, the ability of the poem to speak
to other literary or poetic texts.  I believe that it was Shelley who said
that poetry is ultimately about poetry.  Great poets are constantly in dialogue
with each other.  This was particularly true of haikai, which began as a 
parodic form, by twisting the associations and conventions of classical
literature and poetry.
<p>
one of Basho's innovations was that he went beyond parody and used literary
and historical allusions as a means of elevating haikai, which had hitherto
been considered a low form of amusement.  Many of Basho and Buson's haikai
in fact depend for their depth on reference or allusion to earlier poetry,
from either the Japanese tradition or the Chinese tradition.  For example,
one of Buson's best known <i>hokku</i> (1742) is <i>yanagi chiri shimizu
kare ishi tokoro dokoro.</i>
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
fallen willow leaves --<br>
the clear stream gone dry,<br>
stones here and there</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
The hokku is a description of a natural scene, of "here and now", but it is
simultaneously an allusion to and a haikai variation on a famous waka, or
classical poem, by Saigyo (1118-1190), a 12th century poet: <i>michinobe ni
shimizu nagaruru yanagi kage shibashi tote koso tachitomaritsure 
(Shinkokinshu</i>, Summer, No. 262).
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
by the side of the road<br>
alongside a stream of clear water<br>
in the shade of a willow tree<br>
I paused for what I thought<br>
would be just a moment</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
Basho (1644-94) had earlier written the following poem <i>(ta ichimai uete
tachisaru yanagi kana)</i> in <i>Narrow Road to the Interior (Oku no hosomichi)
</i>, in which the traveler (Basho), having come to the place where Saigyo had
written this poem, relives those emotions: Basho pauses beneath the same willow
tree and before he knows it, a whole field of rice has been planted.
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
a whole field of<br>
rice seedlings planted - I part<br>
from the willow</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
In contrast to Basho's poem, which recaptures the past, Buson's poem is about
loss and the irrevocable passage of time, about the contrast between the
situation now, in autumn, when the stream has dried up and the willow leaves
have fallen, and the past, in summer, when the clear stream beckoned to
Saigyo and the willow tree gave him shlter from the hot summer sun.  Like
many of Basho and Buson's poems, the poem is both about the present and the
past, about the landscape and about other poems and poetic associations.
<p>
The point here is that much of Japanese poetry works off the vertical axis
mentioned earlier.  There are a few, rare examples of this in English haiku.
I give one example, by Bernard Einbond, a New York City poet who recently
passed away, which alludes to Basho's famous frog poem: <i>furuike ya kawazy
tobikomu mozu no oto</i> (an old pond, a frog jumps in, the sound of water).
<p>
</blockquote> <center><i>
frog pond...<br>
a leaf falls in<br>
without a sound</i>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
This haiku deservedly won the Japan Airlines First Prize, in which there
were someting like 40,000 entries.  This poem has a haikai quality that 
Basho would have admired.  In typical haikai fashion, it operates on two
fundamental levels.  On the scenic level, the horizontal axis, it is a
description of a scene from nature, it captures the sense of quiet, eremitic
loneliness that is characteristic of Basho's poetry.  On the vertical axis,
it is an allusive variation, a haikai twist on Basho's famous frog poem,
wittily replacing the frog with the leaf and the sound of the frog jumping
in with no sound.  Einbond's haiku has a sense of immediacy, but at the same
time it speaks to the past; it enters into dialogue with Basho's poem.  In
other words, this haiku goes beyond "the haiku moment", beyond the here and
now, to speak across time.  To compose such haiku is difficult.  But it is
the kind of poetry that can break into the mainstream and can become part
of a poetic heritage.
<p>
The vertical axis does not always have to be a connection to another poem.
It can be what I call cultural memory, a larger body of associations that 
the larger community can identify with.  It could be about a past crisis
(such as the Vietnam War or the loss of a leader) that the poet of a community
is trying to come to terms with.  The key here is the larger frame, the larger
body of associations that carries from one generation to the next and that
goes beyond the here and now, beyond the so-called haiku moment.  The key 
point is that for the horizontal (contemporary) axis to survive, to transcend
time and place, it needs at some point to cross the vertical (historical)
axis; the present moment has to engage with the past or with a broader sense
of time and community (such as family, national or literary history).
<p>
</blockquote><center>
<strong>
Nature and Seasonal Words
</strong>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
One of the major differences between English-language haiku and Japanese haiku
is the use of the seasonal word <i>(kigo)</i>.  There are two formal 
requirements of the hokku, now called haiku: the cutting word, which cuts 
the 17 syllable hokku in two, and the seasonal word.  English-language haiku
poets do not use cutting words per se, but they use the equivalent, either in
the punctuation (such as a dash), with nouns, or syntax.  The effect is very
similar to the cutting word, and there have been many good poems that depend
on the cutting.  However, there is no equivalent to the seasonal word.  In
fact, the use of a seasonal word is not a formal requirement in 
English-language haiku, as it is for most of Japanese haiku.
<p>
In Japan, the seasonal word triggers a series of cultural associations which
have been developed, refined and carefully transmitted for over a thousand
years and which are preserved, transformed and passed on from generation to
generation through seasonal handbooks, which remain in wide use today.  In
Basho's day, seasonal words stood in the shape of a huge pyramid.  At the 
top were the big five, which had been at the core of classical poetry (the
31-syllable waka): the cuckoo <i>(hototogisu)</i> for summer, the cherry 
blossoms for spring, the snow for winter, the bright autumn leaves and the
moon for autumn.  Spreading out from this narrow peak were the other topics
from classical poetry - spring rain <i>(harusame)</i>, orange blossoms <i>
(hanatachibana)</i>, bush warbler <i>(uguisu)</i>, willow tree <i>(yanagi)</i>,
etc.  Occupying the base and the widest area were the vernacular seasonal words
that had been added recently by haikai poets.  In contrast to the elegant
images at the top of the pyramid, the seasonal words at the bottom were taken
from everyday, contemporary, commoner life.  Examples from spring include
dandelion <i>(tanpopo)</i>, garlic <i>(ninniku)</i>, horseradish <i>(wasabi)
</i> and cat's love <i>(neko no koi)</i>.
<p>
From as early as the eleventh century, the poet of classical poetry was
expected to compose on the poetic essence <i>(honi)</i> of a set topic.  The
poetic essence was the established associations at the core of the seasonal
word.  In the case of the warbler <i>(uguisu)</i>, for example, the poet had
to compose on the warbler in regard to the arrival and departure of spring,
about the emergence of the warbler from the mountain glen, or about the 
relationship of the warbler to the plum blossoms.  This poetic essence, the
cluster of associations at the core of the seasonal topic, was thought to
represent the culmination and experience of generations of poets over many
years.  By composing on the poetic essence, the poet could partake of this
communal experience, inherit it, and carry it on.  (This phenomenon is true
of most of the traditional arts.  The beginner must first learn the fundamental
forms, or <i>kata</i>, which represent the accumulated experience of 
generations of previous masters.)  Poets studied Japanese classics such as
<i>The Tale of Genji</i> and the <i>Kokinshu</i>, the first imperial 
anthology of Japanese <i>waka</i> poetry, because these texts were thought
to preserver the poetic essence of nature and the seasons as well as of
famous places.
<p>
Famous places <i>(meisho)</i> in Japanese poetry have a function similar to
the seasonal word.  Each famous place in Japanese poetry had a core of poetic
associations on which the poet was obliged to compose.  Tatsutagawa (Tatsuta
River), for example, meant <i>momiji</i>, or bright autumn leaves.  Poets
such as Saigyo and Basho traveled to famous poetic places - such as 
Tatsutagawa, Yoshino, Matsushima, Shirakawa - in order to partake of this
communal experience, to be inspired by poetic places that had been the
fountainhead of the great poems of the past.  These famous poetic places
provided an opportunity to commune across time with earlier poets.  Like
seasonal words, famous places functioned as a direct pipeline to the 
communal poetic body.  By contrast, there are very few, if any places, in
North America that have a core of established poetic associations of the 
kind found in famous places in Japan.  And accordingly there are relatively
few English haiku on noted places.
<p>
The point here is that the seasonal word, like the famous place name in
Japanese poetry, anchors the poem in not only some aspect of nature but in 
the vertical axis, in a larger communal body of poetic and cultural 
associations.  The seasonal word allows something that is small to gain a
life of its own.  The seasonal word, like the famous place name, also links
the poem to other poems.  In fact, each haiku is in effect part of one gigantic
seasonal poem.
<p>
People have often wondered about the brevity of the Japanese poem.  The
seventeen syllable haiku is the shortest form in world literature, and the
thirty-one syllable <i>waka</i> or <i>tanka</i>, as it is called today, is
probably the second shortest.  How then is it possible for poetry to be so
short and yet still be poetry?  How can there be complexity or high value in
such a simple, brief form?  First, the brevity and the overt simplicity allow
everyone to participate, making it a communal, social medium.  Second, the poem
can be short and still complex sinc eit is actually part of a larger, more
complex poetic body.  When the poet takes up one of the topics at the top of
the seasonal pyramid or visits a famous place, he or she enters into an 
imaginary world that he or she shares with the audience and that connects
to the dead, the ancients.  To compose on the poetic essence of a topic is,
as we saw, to participate in the larger accumulated experience of past poets.
It is for this reason that the audience takes pleasure in very subtle
variations on familiar themes.

This communal body, the vertical axis, however, is in constant need of 
infusion, of new life.  The <i>haikai</i> poet needs the horizontal axis to
seek out the new experience, new language, new topics, new poetic partners.
The seasonal pyramid can be seen as concentric circles of a tree trunk, with
the classical topics at the center, followed by classical linked verse topics,
the <i>haikai</i> topics, and finally modern haiku words on the periphery.  The
innermost circles bear the longest history and are essentially fictional worlds
and the least likely to change.  The outer circles, by contrast, are rooted in
everyday life and in the contemporary, ever-changing world.  Many of those on
the circumference will come and go, never to be seen again.  Without the 
constant addition of new rings, however, the tree will die or turn into a
fossil.  One of the ideals that Basho espoused toward the end of his life was
that of the "unchanging and the ever-changing" <i>(fueki ryuko)</i>.  The
"unchanging" implied the need to seek the "truth of poetic art" <i>(fuga no
makoto)</i>, particularly in the poetic and spiritual tradition, to engage
in the vertical axis, while the "ever changing" referred to the need for 
constant change and renewal, the source of which was ultimately to be found
in everyday life, in the horizontal axis.
<p>
Significantly, the Haiku Society of America definition of haiku does not
mention the seasonal word, which would be mandatory in Japan for most schools.
Maybe half of existing English-language haiku have seasonal words or some 
sense of the season, and even when the haiku do have a seasonal word the 
usually do not server the function that they do in Japanese haiku.  The reason
for this is that the connotations of seasonal words differ greatly from region
to region in North America, not to mention other parts of the world, and 
generally are not tied to specific literary or cultural associations that
would immediately be recognized by the reader.  In Japan, by contrast, for
hundreds of years, the seasonal words have served as a crucial bridge between
the poem and the tradition.  English-language haiku therefore has to depend 
on other dimensions of haiku for its life.
<p>
In short, while haiku in English is inspired by Japanese haiku, it can not and
should not try to duplicate the rules of Japanese haiku because of significant
differences in language, culture and history.  A definition of Engish-language
haiku will thus, by nature, differ from that of Japanese haiku.  If pressed to
give a definition of English-language haiku that would encompass the points 
that I have made here, I would say, echoing the spirit of Basho's own poetry,
that <i>haiku in English is a short poem, usually written in one to three
lines, that seeks out new and revealing perspectives on the human and physical
condition, focusing on the immediate physical world around us, particularly
that of nature, and on the workings of the human imagination, memory, 
literature and history.</i>  There are already a number of fine North American
haiku poets working within this frame so this definition is intended both to
encourage an existing trend and to affirm new space that goes beyond existing
definitions of haiku.

<strong>
Senryu and English-Language Haiku
</strong>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
Maybe close to half of English-language haiku, including many of the best ones,
are in fact a form of <i>senryu</i>, seventeen syllable poems that do not
require a seasonal word and that focus on human condition and social
circumstances, often in a humorous or satirical fashion.  I think that this is
fine.  English-language haiku should not try to imitate Japanese haiku, since
it is working under very different circumstances.  It must have a life and
evolution of its own.
<p>
Senryu, as it evolved in Japan in the latter half of the eighteenth century,
when it blossomed into an independent form, was heavily satirical, poking fun
at contemporary manners and human foibles.  English-language haiku magazines
have established a distinction between the two forms, of haiku and senryu, in 
which those poems associated with nature are placed in the haiku category and
those with non-natural subjects in the senryu category.  According to the Haiku
Society of America, haiku is the "essence of a movement keenly perceived in
which nature is linked to human nature".  Senryu, by contrast, is "primarily
concerned with human nature; often humorous or satiric".  While this definition
of English-language senryu is appropriate, that for English-language haiku,
which tends, by nature, to overlap with senryu, seems too limited.
<p>
One consequence of a narrower definition of haiku is that English-language
anthologies of haiku are overwhelmingly set in country or natural settings
even though ninety percent of the haiku poets actually live in urban
environments.  To exaggerate the situation, North American haiku poets are
given the alternative of either writing serious poetry on nature (defined
as haiku) or of writing humorous poetry on non-nature topics (defined as
<i>senryu</i>).  This would seem to discourage haiku poets from writing
serious poetry on the immediate urban environment or broader social issues.
Topics such as subways, commuter driving, movie theaters, shopping malls, etc.,
while falling outside of the traditional notion of nature, in fact provide
some of the richest sources for modern haiku, as much recent English-language
haiku has revealed, and should be considered part of nature in the broadest
sense.
<p>
For this reason I am now editing a volume of New York or urban haiku, which,
according to the narrow definition of haiku, would often be discouraged or
disqualified, but which, in my mind, represents the original spirit of Japanese
haikai in focusing on the immediate physical environment.  Projects such as
Dee Evett's "Haiku on 42nd Street", in which he presented urban haiku on empty
movie theatre marquees in Times Square, are, in this regard, both innovative
and inspiring.

<strong>
Conclusion: Some Characteristics of Haikai
</strong>
<p>
</center><blockquote>
The dilemma is this: on the one hand, the great attraction of haiku is its
democracy, its ability to reach out, to be available to everyone.  There is no
poetry like haiku when it comes to this.  Haiku has a special meaning and
function for everyone.  It can be a form of therapy.  It can be a way to tap
into one's psyche.  Haiku can do all these things.  And it can do these things
because it is short, because the rules are simple, because it can focus on the
moment.
<p>
However, if haiku is to rise to the level of serious poetry, literature that is
widely respected and admired, that is taught and studied, commentated on, that
can have impact on other non-haiku poets, then it must have a complexity that
gives it depth and that allows it to both focus on and rise above the specific
moment or time.  Basho, Buson and other masters achieved this through various
forms of textual density, including metaphor, allegory, symbolism and allusion, 
as well as through the constant search for new topics.  For North American
poets, for whom the seasonal word cannot function in the fashion that it did
for these Japanese masters, this becomes a more pressing issue, with the need
to explore not only metaphorical and symbolic possibilities but new areas - 
such as history, urban life, social ills, death and war, cyberspace, Haiku 
need not and should not be confined to a narrow definition of nature poetry, 
particularly since the ground rules are completely different from those in
Japan.
<p>
How then can haiku achieve that goal in the space of seventeen syllables?
The answer is that it does not necessarily have to.  One of the assumptions 
that Basho and others made about the hokku (haiku) was that it was unfinished.
The hokku was only the beginning of a dialogue; it had to be answered by the
reader or another poet or painter.  Haikai in its most fundamental form, as
linked verse, is about linking one verse to another, one person to another.
Haikai is also about exchange, about sending and answering, greeting and 
bidding farewall, about celebrating and mourning.  Haikai was also about
mutual composition, about completing or complementing the work of others,
adding poetry and calligraphy to someone's printing, adding a prose passage
to a friend's poem, etc.
<p>
One consequence is that haikai and the hokku in particular is often best
appreciated and read as part of a sequence, as part of an essay, a poetry
collection, a diary or travel narrative, all forms that reveal the process
of exchange, linkage, and that give haikai and haiku a larger context.  Basho's
best work was <i>Narrow Road to the Interior (Oku no hosomichi)</i>, in which
the haiku was embedded in a larger prose narrative and was part of a larger
chaing of texts.
<p>
In Basho's day, haikai was two things: 1) performance and social act, and 
2) literary text.  As a social act, as an elegent form of conversation, haikai
had to be easily accessible; it had to be spontaneous; it had to perform social
and religious functions.  Thus, half of Basho's haiku were greetings, parting
poems, poetic prayers.  They served very specific functions and were anchored
in a specific place and time, in a dialogic exchange with other individuals.
For Basho, however, haikai was also a literary text that had to transcend time
and place, be understood by those who were not at the place of composition.
To achieve this goal, Basho repeatedly rewrote his poetry, made it fictional,
gave it new settings, added layers of meaning, emphasized the vertical axis
(linking it to history and other literary texts), so that the poem would have
an impact beyond its original circumstances.  One hopes that more North 
American haiku poets can take inspiration from this complex work.
