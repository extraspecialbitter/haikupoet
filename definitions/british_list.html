The following checklist is being distributed by the British Haiku
Society as part of a postal kukai for members.  I did not write it
myself and make no claim that these points are a "definitive list". I
have posted them as I think they might be of general interest.
<p>
...it might [also] be worth recording that the guidelines came from 
the Wales region of the BHS. I'm not sure that all regions are using 
the same list.

<p>
Write only when you have been moved, touched or inspired by an actual
experience.
<p>
Just relax and be yourself, without straining or effort. So be honest,
simple, clear and straightforward. Avoid cliché, cleverness and
wordiness.
<p>
Say how it is without abstractions, avoid explanations and
philosophising, leave space for readers to feel their own responses.
<p>
Resist heaviness and overloading;  prefer allusion and understatement.
<p>
Try to express your feelings through the images you use, rather than
actually saying you are "sad" or "lonely". This gives space for the
readers to experience those feelings for themselves.
<p>
Many of the best haiku present unexpected and contrasting images. These
can arouse profound and subtle emotions and can convey layers of elusive
meaning.
<p>
Finally, are there words which you could omit which would make the haiku
work better? And what happens if you change the lines around?
