<p> Most traditional Japanese haiku use 17 syllables <i>(onji)</i>; some don&#8217;t. 
  Most traditional western haiku have 3 lines; some don&#8217;t. Most traditional 
  haiku also have seasonal <i>(kigo)</i> and cutting <i>(kireji)</i> words; some 
  don&#8217;t. Some believe metaphors should be completely avoided; others feel 
  they are inherent. Some believe that haiku should be present tense, should be 
  from actual lived experience, should be concrete, should contain juxtaposition, 
  shouldn&#8217;t rhyme,etc. None of these characteristics are necessary. Haiku&#8212; 
  literally meaning &#8220;playful verse&#8221; and originating as the basis of 
  a collectively-written linked poem <i>(renga)</i>&#8212;are meant to be played 
  with. Basho himself (along with other haiku masters) led the way by both following 
  and straying from these guidelines. A haiku is simply a very short evocative 
  poem that captures a moment of awareness; it is a poetic snapshot. Nothing more, 
  nothing less. <br>
