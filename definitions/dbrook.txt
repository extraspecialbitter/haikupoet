Most traditional Japanese haiku use 17 syllables (onji);
some don^Òt. Most traditional western haiku have 3 lines;
some don^Òt. Most traditional haiku also have seasonal
(kigo) and cutting (kireji) words; some don^Òt. Some believe
metaphors should be completely avoided; others feel they
are inherent. Some believe that haiku should be present
tense, should be from actual lived experience, should be
concrete, should contain juxtaposition, etc. None of these
characteristics are necessary. Haiku, literally meaning
^Óplayful verse^Ô and originating as the basis of a
collectively-written linked poem (renga), is meant to be
played with. Basho himself led the way by both following
and straying from each of these guidelines. A haiku is
simply a very short evocative poem that captures a moment
of awareness. It is a poetic snapshot. Nothing more,
nothing less.
