It isn't microwave poetry.  It's not quite as simple as popping in 
seventeen syllables and pressing the "5-7-5" setting.  These days,
depending upon where you live and how you've lived, haiku could mean
alot of very different things. <br><br> 

Literally, haiku is a Japanese word that means "playful verse".  In ancient
Japan, a "hokku" (literally "starting verse") represented the first three
lines, or "link", of a much larger work, called a "renku" (literally "linked
verse"), which would alternate between three lines of seventeen syllables
and two lines of fourteen syllables - going on for 36, 72 or 100 "links".
Prior to the 17th Century, a renku was an integral part of an all-night
party among the upper class.  The links were usually humorous, romantic
or political, not exactly works of literary merit. <BR><BR>

All of this changed with Matsuo Bash&ocirc; (1644-1694), who brought a serious,
Zen Buddhist discipline to the practise, transforming it from a party game
into an art form.  Bash&ocirc; lived a wanderer's life, developing a reputation,
as well as a significant following of dedicated disciples, in many Japanese
cities.  While Bash&ocirc; usually adhered to the 5-7-5 syllable format of
ancient hokku, he also instituted other principles.  Most of his haiku
could be seen as brief snapshots of nature - like momentary entries in
a journal of wandering.  They also included another ingredient: the
poet himself, but usually as an object surrounded by nature instead of
the main subject of the poem.  This Zen paradox of being completely 
empty of self while being ultimately self-aware remains an important
ingredient in many haiku. <BR><BR>

About 200 years after Bash&ocirc; died, haiku was little more than an historical
artifact until Masaoka Shiki recognized the potential of such a terse
literary form and single-handedly revived the practise in Japan.  A few
years later, American poets such as Ezra Pound took an active interest
in haiku, sparking the birth of English-language haiku as a legitimate
poetic form. <BR><BR>

While many English haiku poets try to stick to seventeen syllables, 
incompatibilities between the English and Japanese languages render 
this restriction less important than the science of capturing a momentary
image in words.  Most "haijin" will agree that the haiku should be no
longer than the duration of a breath, and that its subject matter should
represent an event or an observation that was experienced directly by
the author.  So on the one hand the subject of a haiku should be very
much literal, while the effect of the subject on the author, more subtle
but equally important to the haiku, could be literal, symbolic or even
imagined.  Probably a good time for an example.  Consider one of Bash&ocirc;'s
later works (1689): <BR><BR>

	autumn wind -- <BR>
	a graveyard in Ise <BR>
	even more lonely <BR> 
<i>(tr. - Makoto Ueda)</i><br><br>

The apparent subject of the haiku is the autumn wind.  But what does
Bash&ocirc; do?  He sneaks himself into the haiku, alluding to his loneliness,
by introducing a second subject, the graveyard. <BR> <BR>

This technique of introducing a second subject into a haiku for the purpose
of contrast or complement is called "juxtaposition".  After brevity, it is 
the most distinctive attribute of modern haiku.  Here is a haiku by Kikaku,
one of Bash&ocirc;'s prized disciples: <BR> <BR>

	now the dragonflies <BR>
	cease their mad gyrations... <BR>
	a thin crescent moon <BR> 
<i>(tr. - Peter Beilenson)</i><br><br>

Two seemingly irrelevant subjects are brought together - the dragonflies
and the moon, in order to draw the reader into the scene.  The technique
of juxtapositioning the two images causes us to stop to look at the moon,
at which point we realize that the frisky dragonflies have done the same
thing.  The effect is an unexpected identification with the insects - at
least for that moment. <BR> <BR>

My favorite haiku of all demonstrates this technique beautifully.  Issa
wrote this haiku in the early 19th century, after the death of his infant
daughter: <BR> <BR>

	dew evaporates -- <BR>
	and all our life is dew: <BR>
	so dear, so fresh, so fleeting <BR>
<i>(tr. - Peter Beilenson)</i><br><br>

The apparent subject of the haiku is dew, but Issa is not writing about
dew at all, but rather his identification with dew as a symbol of our
short lives. <BR> <BR>

Okay, I've given a few definitions and examples.  Why do *I* like haiku?
It is immediate - there is no need to dig into the words and ask "what 
did that mean"?  More often than not, you'll read a haiku and say "ouch!"
or "ooooh..." or words to that effect.  I also appreciate the discipline
of stripping words to the bare essential needed to make the connection
between the author and the reader.  Haiku doesn't tell a story - it takes
a still photograph of a flash of lightning, in all its beauty, terror
and suddenness.  It takes the time to notice a dead bird but doesn't
speculate on cause and effect.  It celebrates a kiss, a smile or a
fragrance, by simply allowing it to have its moment, usually when it
is least expected... <BR> <BR>

	first date --<BR>
	under the streetlights<BR>
	our shadows hold hands
