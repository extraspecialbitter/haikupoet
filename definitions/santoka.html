Real haiku is the soul of poetry.  Anything that is not actually present
in one's heart is not haiku.  The moon glows, flowers bloom, insects cry,
water flows.  There is no place we cannot find flowers or think of the
moon.  This is the essence of haiku.  Go beyond the restrictions of your
era, forget about purpose or meaning, separate yourself from historical
limitations -- there you'll find the essence of true art, religion, and
science.
