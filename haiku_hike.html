<h2>The Renewability Haiku Hike</h2>
<p>The &#8220;Renewability Haiku Hike&#8221; will take place on Saturday and Sunday, November 18th and 19th 2006. 
On Saturday 18th, there will be a Haiku Workshop and on Sunday 19th a walk around the London 2012 Olympic 
site. All welcome to one or both these events.</p>

<p>Booking required: please book with <a href="http://www.lansburyvoices.org.uk/contact.html">Vicky Coakley</a>.</p>

<p>On Saturday, 18th November, there will be a Haiku Poetry workshop at the Hind Grove Community Base 
(near the junction of Hind Grove and Stainsby Road). This will be lead by <a href="http://skinafterskin.blogspot.com/">Paul Conneally</a>, and will last 
from 2pm to 5pm. The hike will take place on Sunday 19th November from 2pm and will take at least an hour, 
possibly two. During the walk, participants will be encouraged to take photographs. Haiku poetry can then 
be attached to some of the images. At the end of walk, the images and haiku poems will be collected, and 
later published on the website.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Renewability Haiku Hike&#8221; will be suitable for most people, but there are steps in 
places. The walk will be along the tow path of the River Lea Navigation in the East End of London, which 
is being transformed for the London Olympics 2012.</p>

<p>The walk will start and end at House Mill. The River Lea Tidal Mill Trust will open their cafe for 
refreshments on the day.</p>
