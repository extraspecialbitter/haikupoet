Hi Brett, Paul

Here's our Saturday night bluenotes.  Let me know of any misspellings
and/ or revisions and footnotes as needed.

Brett, I italicized  "if you see my little red rooster," because I
thought it was the title of a tune.  Should it also be in caps?

Walking Blues

Walking Blues
Sun House summons the delta
in his voice                                  bp

       scratching DJs
       digging their grooves                     rdg

neighbors with wheel barrows
help themselves
to my soil                                    pdm

       ringing guitar notes
       the smell of frying chicken                  bp

[B]
the moon at midnight
lights the path
Bird in the outhouse                         rdg

       watching an old movie
       I miss my cat                             pdm

the harp player
wobbling in counterpoint
to the guitar's strumming                       bp

       across the alley
       bamboo windchimes                       rdg

abandoned house
poppies bloom
in an old boat                              pdm

       beer in hand
       swaying to boogie woogie piano        bp

The Happy Swallow
the homeless stop by
for a night cap                             rdg

       seagulls circling
       the open dumpster                          pdm

[2F]
the King Bee buzzing
Slim Harpo's nasal vocals
cut through the late evening                 bp

       spring breeze
       the pollen count high                      rdg

pot smoke
entangled
in the ceiling fan                               pdm

       echoes from the tube amp
       the guitar player on full reverb           bp

Zen retreat
the haiku poet
deaf in one ear                                 rdg

       a pair of eyes
       on a passing boxcar                        pdm

the harmonic player
imitates
a train whistle                             bp

       blowing smoke rings
       in his girlfriend's face                      rdg

[2B]
breathless
her lips
on the mouthpiece                            pdm

       if you see my little red rooster
       please drive him home                  bp

cell phone call at 3 a.m.
the lovebird
answers                                        rdg

       deep sigh
       a role of dice                              pdm
