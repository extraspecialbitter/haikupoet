okay, I'm not a native Bostonian.  born and raised in a small town
called New York, I spent my adult life eeking out a nomadic existence,
never quite comfortable in any given place for very long.  ironically
I find it perfectly fitting to settle in a region that prides itself
on its toughness, but I couldn't be more surprised to hear myself
refering to it as "home".<P>

it must be the trains.<P>

I've lived in several large cities knit together by mass transit,
but only in the past few months have I found myself utterly obsessed
with the sight, sound and feel of the railroad.  I dream of trains.
when I can't sleep, I imagine the wind to be the incoming red line,
and I'm out like a light.<P>

not all of these poems speak of trains, but all of them - from the
dirges of longing to the whimsical musings of office supplies - possess
the restlessness of Porter Square or the loneliness of North Station
after the last train.  like the T from Kendall Square they are my
way home. <P>

I hope you enjoy the ride.<P>
